# CV-Project

The idea is to use Mathematical Mortphology to implement a maze solver.

PRE-REQUISISTES:

  * Library:
    - OpenCV installed in own computer

  * Image:
   - The maze has to be composed by ONLY 2 walls
   - The maze has to have 1 entrance and 1 exit only
   - The maze can be rotates as preference, the program is orientation-indipendent


## HOW TO RUN

 step 1: Clone the repositore with gitClone or download the folder from this page
 step 2: Compile the program with a c++ compiler (`Ubuntu: g++ mazeSolver.cpp -o test -std=c++11 $(pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv)`)
